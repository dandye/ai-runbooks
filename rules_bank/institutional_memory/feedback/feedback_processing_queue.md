# Feedback Processing Queue

## Purpose

This document tracks analyst feedback awaiting processing into institutional memories. It serves as a staging area for feedback collection, prioritization, and systematic conversion into actionable memory files.

## Current Queue Status

**Total Pending Items**: 3
**High Priority Items**: 1
**Medium Priority Items**: 2
**Average Processing Time**: 2.3 days

## Pending Feedback Items

### QUEUE-001: High Priority
**Date Submitted**: 2025-08-22
**Feedback Source**: senior_analyst_k_thompson
**Related Runbook**: run_books/malware_triage.md
**Related Persona**: personas/soc_analyst_tier_2.md

**Feedback Text**: 
"When triaging suspected malware samples, we need to add a step to check our internal sandbox results before submitting to external analysis. Our internal sandbox often catches organization-specific configurations and provides results 5x faster than external services. This is especially critical during incident response when time is crucial."

**Processing Priority**: High (impacts incident response efficiency)
**Estimated Impact**: High (affects malware analysis speed and quality)
**Complexity**: Medium (requires integration with internal sandbox systems)
**Target Processing Date**: 2025-08-24

**Processing Notes**:
- Requires validation of internal sandbox API availability
- Need to identify specific integration points in malware triage workflow
- Should create procedure_addition type memory
- Consider creating separate memory for incident response scenarios

### QUEUE-002: Medium Priority
**Date Submitted**: 2025-08-21
**Feedback Source**: analyst_j_patel
**Related Runbook**: run_books/ioc_threat_hunt.md
**Related Persona**: personas/threat_hunter.md

**Feedback Text**:
"During IOC-based threat hunts, we should always pivot to check for related file hashes and network indicators in the same timeframe. I've found several cases where the initial IOC was just the tip of the iceberg, and expanding the search horizontally revealed much larger campaigns. This should be standard procedure after finding initial matches."

**Processing Priority**: Medium (improves hunt thoroughness)
**Estimated Impact**: Medium (enhances threat detection coverage)
**Complexity**: Low (straightforward procedure addition)
**Target Processing Date**: 2025-08-25

**Processing Notes**:
- Create procedure_addition memory for IOC pivoting
- Define specific pivot criteria and techniques
- Include examples of successful horizontal expansion
- Consider performance impact of expanded searches

### QUEUE-003: Medium Priority
**Date Submitted**: 2025-08-20
**Feedback Source**: analyst_m_garcia
**Related Runbook**: run_books/suspicious_login_triage.md
**Related Persona**: personas/soc_analyst_tier_1.md

**Feedback Text**:
"For suspicious login alerts involving VIP users (executives, IT admins, finance team), we need to add an immediate notification step to the relevant team lead, even for low-priority alerts. We've had several incidents where VIP compromise was delayed in detection because the alerts looked routine. A quick heads-up call can prevent major escalation."

**Processing Priority**: Medium (improves VIP protection)
**Estimated Impact**: Medium (reduces VIP compromise detection time)
**Complexity**: Medium (requires VIP list maintenance and notification integration)
**Target Processing Date**: 2025-08-26

**Processing Notes**:
- Create procedure_addition memory for VIP notification
- Define VIP user identification criteria
- Establish notification procedures and escalation paths
- Consider compliance and privacy implications

## Processing Workflow

### 1. Intake Assessment
- Review feedback for clarity and completeness
- Identify affected runbooks and personas
- Assess potential impact and implementation complexity
- Assign priority level (High/Medium/Low)

### 2. Impact Analysis
- Estimate organizational benefit of implementing feedback
- Assess risks of current procedure vs. proposed enhancement
- Consider resource requirements and technical dependencies
- Evaluate alignment with security strategy and priorities

### 3. Memory Design
- Transform feedback into structured memory format
- Design derived procedures and application criteria
- Define success metrics and validation requirements
- Create initial confidence scoring framework

### 4. Stakeholder Review
- Present proposed memory to relevant subject matter experts
- Gather additional input and validation
- Refine memory design based on expert feedback
- Obtain approval for memory creation and deployment

### 5. Memory Creation
- Execute `run_books/memory_creation.md` runbook
- Create formal memory file with proper structure
- Set up validation framework and success metrics
- Document creation process and initial deployment

## Priority Classification

### High Priority Criteria
- Impacts incident response or critical security operations
- Addresses known gaps that have caused security issues
- Provides significant efficiency improvements for high-frequency tasks
- Requested by senior staff or identified through formal process improvement

### Medium Priority Criteria
- Improves operational efficiency or analysis quality
- Addresses moderate frequency issues or procedures
- Provides moderate impact on security posture
- Represents best practices from experienced analysts

### Low Priority Criteria
- Nice-to-have improvements with limited impact
- Convenience features that don't significantly affect security
- Suggestions that require significant resources for minimal benefit
- Ideas that need more validation before implementation

## Quality Gates

Before processing feedback into memories:

### Completeness Check
- [ ] Feedback clearly describes current issue or gap
- [ ] Proposed solution is specific and actionable
- [ ] Context and rationale are well explained
- [ ] Impact on existing procedures is understood

### Feasibility Assessment
- [ ] Technical requirements are available or obtainable
- [ ] Resource requirements are reasonable
- [ ] Implementation complexity is manageable
- [ ] No conflicts with existing procedures or policies

### Value Validation
- [ ] Clear benefit to security operations identified
- [ ] Success metrics can be defined and measured
- [ ] Risk/benefit analysis supports implementation
- [ ] Stakeholder support or need confirmed

## Metrics and Tracking

### Processing Performance
- **Average Queue Time**: Time from submission to processing start
- **Processing Duration**: Time from start to memory creation completion
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of processed feedback that becomes active memories
- **Impact Realization**: Measured benefits of implemented memories

### Feedback Quality
- **Completeness Score**: Assessment of feedback detail and clarity
- **Actionability Rate**: Percentage of feedback that can be directly processed
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Feedback provider satisfaction with processing outcome
- **Implementation Success**: Success rate of memories created from feedback

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop Optimization
- Regular review of processing bottlenecks and delays
- Analyst feedback on the feedback process itself
- Streamlining of common feedback patterns and templates
- Automation opportunities for routine processing steps

### Pattern Recognition
- Identification of recurring feedback themes
- Proactive memory creation for predictable gaps
- Systematic analysis of feedback sources and patterns
- Integration with formal process improvement initiatives
