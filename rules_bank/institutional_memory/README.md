# Institutional Memory Framework

## Overview

The Institutional Memory Framework enables AI agents to learn from analyst feedback and operational experience, transforming static runbooks into adaptive, organization-specific expertise. This system maintains full backward compatibility while adding dynamic learning capabilities.

## Directory Structure

```
institutional_memory/
├── memories/           # Individual memory files for learned procedures
├── patterns/          # Recurring operational patterns and lessons
├── adaptations/       # Persona-specific behavioral modifications  
├── feedback/          # Analyst feedback collection and processing
├── MEMORY-THESAURUS.md # Memory-specific controlled vocabulary
└── README.md          # This file
```

## Core Components

### Memories (`memories/`)
Individual memory files that capture specific procedural improvements or contextual adaptations based on analyst feedback and operational experience. Each memory is linked to specific runbooks and personas.

### Patterns (`patterns/`)
Recurring operational patterns, common false positive signatures, escalation triggers, and organizational-specific threat indicators that emerge from collective operational experience.

### Adaptations (`adaptations/`)
Persona-specific behavioral modifications that customize how different security roles (Tier 1 Analyst, Threat Hunter, etc.) should execute standard procedures based on organizational context.

### Feedback (`feedback/`)
Collection and processing pipeline for analyst feedback, including pending feedback queue, processed feedback logs, and feedback effectiveness tracking.

## Memory File Format

All memory files use standardized YAML frontmatter with required fields:

```yaml
---
runbook: "run_books/triage_alerts.md"           # Source runbook reference
persona: "personas/soc_analyst_tier_1.md"      # Applicable persona(s)
source_step: "Step 3: IOC Enrichment"          # Specific step modified
confidence: 0.95                               # Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
last_updated: "2025-08-23"                    # Last modification date
feedback_source: "analyst_d_anderson"          # Original feedback source
validation_count: 5                           # Number of successful applications
success_rate: 0.92                           # Application success rate
related_cases: ["CASE-2024-001"]             # Related case references

```

## Integration Points

- **Personas**: Memory queries integrated into existing persona workflows
- **Runbooks**: Memory checks performed before critical procedural steps
- **Reporting**: Memory applications tracked in standard operational reports
- **Multi-LLM**: Compatible with Claude, Cline, and Gemini CLI through symlink architecture

## Workflow Overview

1. **Memory Creation**: Analyst feedback processed into structured memory files
2. **Memory Query**: Agents check for relevant memories before executing procedures
3. **Memory Application**: High-confidence memories propose alternative procedures
4. **Validation**: Memory effectiveness tracked and confidence adjusted
5. **Continuous Learning**: System adapts based on operational outcomes

## Getting Started

1. Review existing memory templates in `memories/` directory
2. Understand memory file format requirements
3. Use memory management runbooks for creating/updating memories
4. Monitor memory effectiveness through reporting integration

## Compatibility

This framework maintains 100% backward compatibility with existing runbooks and personas. All enhancements are additive - existing workflows continue unchanged while gaining adaptive capabilities.
