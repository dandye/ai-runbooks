# Runbook: Memory System Optimization

## Objective

To systematically analyze, optimize, and maintain the institutional memory system for peak performance, ensuring optimal memory confidence levels, pattern recognition accuracy, and overall system effectiveness.

## Scope

Covers memory system performance analysis, confidence score optimization, pattern effectiveness tuning, memory lifecycle management, and system health monitoring. Includes both automated optimization processes and manual review procedures for maintaining system excellence.

## Inputs

- `${OPTIMIZATION_PERIOD}`: Time period for analysis (default: last 30 days)
- `${PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD}`: Minimum acceptable performance metrics (default: 0.80 success rate)
- `${CONFIDENCE_ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR}`: Tuning sensitivity (default: 0.1)
- `${OPTIMIZATION_SCOPE}`: Specific optimization focus (all, confidence, patterns, lifecycle)

## Tools

- `search_files`: Analyze memory files and application logs
- `read_file`: Review individual memory performance data
- `replace_in_file`: Update memory confidence scores and parameters
- `write_to_file`: Generate optimization reports and recommendations
- **Common Steps:** `common_steps/generate_report_file.md`

## Workflow Steps & Diagram

### 1. System Health Assessment

**Performance Data Collection:**
- Analyze all memory application logs from `institutional_memory/*/application_log` entries
- Calculate system-wide performance metrics:
  - Overall success rate across all memories
  - Average confidence scores and trends
  - Memory application frequency and distribution
  - Pattern recognition accuracy rates

**Metric Calculations:**
```yaml
system_metrics:
  total_applications: ${TOTAL_MEMORY_APPLICATIONS}
  success_rate: ${SUCCESSFUL_APPLICATIONS / TOTAL_APPLICATIONS}
  average_confidence: ${SUM_CONFIDENCE_SCORES / TOTAL_MEMORIES}
  high_confidence_ratio: ${HIGH_CONFIDENCE_MEMORIES / TOTAL_MEMORIES}
  application_frequency: ${APPLICATIONS_PER_DAY_AVERAGE}
```

### 2. Memory Performance Analysis

**Individual Memory Assessment:**
For each memory file in `institutional_memory/memories/`:

**Performance Scoring:**
- **Effectiveness Score** = (Success Rate × 0.4) + (Application Frequency × 0.3) + (Time Savings × 0.3)
- **Quality Score** = (Confidence Level × 0.5) + (Validation Count × 0.3) + (Recent Performance × 0.2)
- **Overall Score** = (Effectiveness Score × 0.6) + (Quality Score × 0.4)

**Categorization:**
```yaml
memory_categories:
  high_performers: # Overall Score ≥ 0.85
    - memories with consistent success and high impact
  moderate_performers: # Overall Score 0.65-0.84  
    - memories with good performance, optimization potential
  underperformers: # Overall Score < 0.65
    - memories requiring attention or retirement
  inactive_memories: # No applications in 60+ days
    - memories potentially obsolete
```

### 3. Confidence Score Optimization

**Automated Confidence Tuning:**

**High Performers Enhancement:**
- Memories with success rate > 0.90 and ≥5 applications → Confidence += 0.05 (max 0.95)
- Consistent performance over 30+ days → Additional +0.02 stability bonus

**Moderate Performers Adjustment:**
- Success rate 0.70-0.89 → Confidence = (Success Rate × 0.8) + (Current Confidence × 0.2)
- Mixed results → Confidence maintained with increased monitoring

**Underperformers Reduction:**
- Success rate < 0.60 → Confidence -= 0.10 (min 0.3)
- Recent failures (last 5 applications) → Confidence -= 0.05

**Confidence Boundaries:**
```yaml
confidence_rules:
  maximum_confidence: 0.95  # Prevent over-confidence
  minimum_active: 0.30      # Below this, flag for review
  auto_retirement: 0.20     # Automatic retirement threshold
  new_memory_max: 0.50      # Cap for newly created memories
```

### 4. Pattern Recognition Optimization

**Pattern Effectiveness Analysis:**
- Analyze `institutional_memory/patterns/` for recognition accuracy
- Calculate false positive/negative rates for organizational patterns
- Optimize pattern recognition thresholds and criteria

**Pattern Tuning:**
```yaml
pattern_optimization:
  recognition_accuracy: # Target ≥ 0.90
    - true_positive_rate: ${CORRECT_PATTERN_MATCHES / TOTAL_PATTERN_APPLICATIONS}
    - false_positive_rate: ${INCORRECT_MATCHES / TOTAL_PATTERN_APPLICATIONS}
  
  threshold_adjustments:
    - high_accuracy_patterns: increase_confidence_threshold
    - moderate_accuracy: maintain_current_threshold  
    - low_accuracy: decrease_threshold_or_retire
```

### 5. Memory Lifecycle Automation

**Automated Lifecycle Management:**

**Promotion Candidates:**
```yaml
promotion_criteria:
  high_confidence_promotion: # 0.7 → 0.8+ tier
    - success_rate: ≥ 0.85
    - application_count: ≥ 10
    - recent_performance: ≥ 0.90
  
  auto_apply_eligibility: # Enable automatic application
    - confidence: ≥ 0.90
    - success_rate: ≥ 0.92
    - validation_count: ≥ 15
```

**Retirement Candidates:**
```yaml
retirement_criteria:
  performance_retirement:
    - confidence: ≤ 0.20
    - success_rate: ≤ 0.50 (last 10 applications)
    - consecutive_failures: ≥ 5
  
  obsolescence_retirement:
    - last_application: > 180 days
    - superseded_by: newer_equivalent_memory
    - organizational_change: deprecated_process
```

### 6. System Health Monitoring

**Health Indicators:**
```yaml
system_health_metrics:
  memory_system_health: # Overall system score 0-1
    - active_memory_ratio: ${ACTIVE_MEMORIES / TOTAL_MEMORIES}
    - success_rate_trend: ${30_DAY_SUCCESS_RATE_CHANGE}
    - application_velocity: ${APPLICATIONS_PER_DAY_TREND}
  
  performance_indicators:
    - excellent: ≥ 0.90 # System performing optimally
    - good: 0.80-0.89   # System performing well
    - fair: 0.70-0.79   # System needs attention
    - poor: < 0.70      # System requires immediate optimization
```

**Alert Conditions:**
- System health score drops below 0.75 for 7+ days
- Memory success rate decreases >10% in 14 days
- High-confidence memory failure rate exceeds 5%
- Pattern recognition accuracy falls below 85%
