# Runbook: Automated Memory Confidence Tuning

## Objective

To automatically adjust memory confidence scores based on operational performance, usage patterns, and effectiveness metrics, ensuring optimal balance between memory utilization and accuracy while maintaining system safety boundaries.

## Scope

Covers automated confidence adjustment algorithms, performance-based tuning, temporal decay factors, safety boundaries, and validation mechanisms. Includes both real-time adjustments and batch optimization processes for maintaining optimal memory confidence levels.

## Inputs

- `${TUNING_MODE}`: Adjustment mode (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
- `${EVALUATION_WINDOW}`: Time window for performance evaluation (default: 30 days)
- `${SAFETY_BOUNDS}`: Confidence adjustment limits per iteration (default: ±0.1)
- `${MINIMUM_APPLICATIONS}`: Required applications for confidence adjustment (default: 3)

## Tools

- `read_file`: Analyze memory files and application logs
- `replace_in_file`: Update memory confidence scores
- `search_files`: Find memories meeting tuning criteria
- `write_to_file`: Log confidence adjustments and rationale

## Automated Tuning Algorithms

### 1. Performance-Based Confidence Adjustment

**Success Rate Algorithm:**
```yaml
confidence_adjustment_formula:
  base_adjustment: (success_rate - 0.75) * adjustment_factor
  adjustment_factor:
    conservative: 0.10
    balanced: 0.15
    aggressive: 0.20
  
  conditions:
    minimum_applications: 3
    evaluation_period: 30_days
    maximum_change: 0.10_per_iteration
```

**Implementation Logic:**
```python
def calculate_confidence_adjustment(memory):
    success_rate = memory.successful_applications / memory.total_applications
    current_confidence = memory.confidence
    
    # Base adjustment from success rate
    base_adjustment = (success_rate - 0.75) * ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR
    
    # Stability bonus for consistent performance
    stability_bonus = calculate_stability_bonus(memory.application_log)
    
    # Recent performance weighting (last 5 applications)
    recent_performance = calculate_recent_performance(memory.application_log[-5:])
    recent_weight = 0.3 if recent_performance != success_rate else 0.0
    
    # Final adjustment calculation
    total_adjustment = base_adjustment + stability_bonus + (recent_weight * recent_performance)
    
    # Apply safety boundaries
    return clamp_adjustment(total_adjustment, current_confidence)
```

### 2. Temporal Performance Weighting

**Recent Performance Emphasis:**
- **Last 5 applications**: 40% weight
- **Last 10 applications**: 30% weight  
- **Older applications**: 30% weight (diminishing)

**Time Decay Factor:**
```yaml
temporal_weighting:
  recent_applications: # Last 30 days
    weight: 0.60
    impact: high_confidence_adjustment
  
  medium_applications: # 31-90 days
    weight: 0.30
    impact: moderate_confidence_adjustment
    
  historical_applications: # >90 days
    weight: 0.10
    impact: minimal_confidence_adjustment
```

### 3. Stability and Consistency Scoring

**Stability Bonus Calculation:**
```yaml
stability_metrics:
  consistent_success: # Success rate variance < 0.1
    bonus: +0.02
    requirement: 10+ applications
  
  improving_trend: # Success rate increasing over time
    bonus: +0.01
    requirement: upward_trend_5+ applications
  
  reliable_performance: # No failures in last 10 applications
    bonus: +0.01
    requirement: perfect_recent_record
```

**Consistency Penalties:**
```yaml
consistency_penalties:
  volatile_performance: # High variance in success rate
    penalty: -0.02
    trigger: variance > 0.15
  
  recent_decline: # Decreasing success rate trend
    penalty: -0.03
    trigger: downward_trend_3+ applications
  
  catastrophic_failure: # Recent complete failure
    penalty: -0.05
    trigger: 0% success in last 3 applications
```

### 4. Context-Aware Adjustments

**Memory Type Modifiers:**
```yaml
memory_type_factors:
  procedure_modification:
    risk_factor: 1.0 # Standard adjustment
    safety_buffer: 0.05
  
  false_positive_pattern:
    risk_factor: 0.8 # More conservative
    safety_buffer: 0.03
  
  performance_optimization:
    risk_factor: 1.2 # More aggressive
    safety_buffer: 0.07
```

**Organizational Impact Weighting:**
```yaml
impact_adjustments:
  high_frequency_memories: # >5 applications/week
    confidence_boost: +0.01
    justification: "High usage validates effectiveness"
  
  critical_workflow_memories: # Incident response, malware analysis
    confidence_restraint: -0.02
    justification: "Extra caution for critical processes"
  
  cross_persona_memories: # Used by multiple personas
    stability_requirement: +2_validation_points
    justification: "Broader impact requires higher validation"
```

## Automated Confidence Boundaries

### Safety Limits
```yaml
confidence_boundaries:
  absolute_maximum: 0.95 # Prevent overconfidence
  absolute_minimum: 0.20 # Below this triggers retirement review
  
  adjustment_limits:
    single_iteration: 0.10 # Maximum change per run
    daily_maximum: 0.15    # Maximum daily change
    weekly_maximum: 0.25   # Maximum weekly change
  
  promotion_thresholds:
    auto_apply_threshold: 0.90
    recommend_threshold: 0.70
    caution_threshold: 0.40
```

### Confidence Tier Management
```yaml
tier_transitions:
  tier_1_auto_apply: # ≥0.90
    requirements:
      - success_rate: ≥0.92
      - applications: ≥15
      - stability_score: ≥0.85
  
  tier_2_recommended: # 0.70-0.89
    requirements:
      - success_rate: ≥0.80
      - applications: ≥8
      - recent_performance: ≥0.75
  
  tier_3_approval_required: # 0.40-0.69
    requirements:
      - success_rate: ≥0.60
      - validation_attempts: ≥3
```

## Workflow Steps
