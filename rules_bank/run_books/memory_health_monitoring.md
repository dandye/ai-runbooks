# Runbook: Memory System Health Monitoring

## Objective

To continuously monitor the institutional memory system health, detect performance anomalies, identify system degradation early, and provide automated alerting for critical issues requiring immediate attention.

## Scope

Covers real-time health monitoring, performance trend analysis, anomaly detection, automated alerting, and preventive maintenance identification. Includes both system-wide monitoring and individual memory health assessment for comprehensive system oversight.

## Inputs

- `${MONITORING_INTERVAL}`: Health check frequency (default: hourly)
- `${ALERT_THRESHOLDS}`: Performance thresholds for alerting
- `${TREND_ANALYSIS_WINDOW}`: Time window for trend analysis (default: 7 days)
- `${HEALTH_HISTORY_RETENTION}`: How long to retain health metrics (default: 90 days)

## Tools

- `search_files`: Analyze memory performance data
- `read_file`: Review individual memory health metrics
- `write_to_file`: Generate health reports and alerts
- `list_files`: Monitor memory system file integrity
