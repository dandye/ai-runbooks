# Runbook: Automated Memory Lifecycle Management

## Objective

To automatically manage the complete lifecycle of institutional memories from creation through retirement, including intelligent promotion, performance-based evolution, automated retirement, and lifecycle optimization for maintaining a healthy, effective memory ecosystem.

## Scope

Covers automated memory promotion, performance-based lifecycle transitions, intelligent retirement decisions, memory evolution tracking, and lifecycle optimization. Includes both proactive lifecycle management and reactive maintenance for optimal memory system health.

## Inputs

- `${LIFECYCLE_ANALYSIS_WINDOW}`: Time period for lifecycle assessment (default: 90 days)
- `${PROMOTION_CRITERIA_MODE}`: Promotion strictness (conservative, standard, accelerated)
- `${RETIREMENT_POLICY}`: Retirement approach (aggressive, balanced, conservative)
- `${EVOLUTION_TRACKING}`: Track memory evolution over time (enabled/disabled)

## Tools

- `search_files`: Analyze memory performance and usage patterns
- `read_file`: Review individual memory lifecycle status
- `replace_in_file`: Update memory metadata and lifecycle status
- `write_to_file`: Create lifecycle reports and retirement records

## Automated Lifecycle Framework

### 1. Memory Lifecycle Stages

**Lifecycle Stage Definitions:**
```yaml
lifecycle_stages:
  nascent: # 0-7 days old, <5 applications
    characteristics:
      - newly_created_memory
      - limited_application_history
      - high_uncertainty_about_effectiveness
    confidence_cap: 0.50
    monitoring: intensive_daily_review
    promotion_eligibility: false
  
  developing: # 8-30 days old, 5-15 applications
    characteristics:

### 2. Automated Promotion System

**Promotion Criteria Matrix:**
```yaml
promotion_criteria:
  tier_1_to_tier_2: # Low confidence → Medium confidence (0.4 → 0.7)
    requirements:
      success_rate: ≥0.75
      minimum_applications: 8
      evaluation_period: 21_days
      stability_score: ≥0.70
      analyst_feedback: neutral_or_positive
    
  tier_2_to_tier_3: # Medium confidence → High confidence (0.7 → 0.85)
    requirements:
      success_rate: ≥0.85
      minimum_applications: 15
      evaluation_period: 45_days
      stability_score: ≥0.80
      cross_analyst_validation: 2+_different_analysts
    
  tier_3_to_auto_apply: # High confidence → Auto-apply (0.85 → 0.90+)
    requirements:
      success_rate: ≥0.92
      minimum_applications: 25
      evaluation_period: 60_days
      stability_score: ≥0.90
      zero_critical_failures: last_20_applications

```

**Promotion Decision Algorithm:**
```python
def evaluate_promotion_eligibility(memory):
    current_stage = determine_lifecycle_stage(memory)
    performance_metrics = calculate_performance_metrics(memory)
    
    # Check basic promotion eligibility
    if not current_stage.promotion_eligibility:
        return {"eligible": False, "reason": "lifecycle_stage_restriction"}
    
    # Evaluate against promotion criteria
    for tier_transition, criteria in PROMOTION_CRITERIA.items():
        if meets_promotion_criteria(memory, criteria):
            return {
                "eligible": True,
                "target_tier": tier_transition.split("_to_")[1],
                "confidence_target": calculate_target_confidence(criteria),
                "justification": format_promotion_justification(memory, criteria)
            }
